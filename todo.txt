code generate socketservice/socktserver
    - put client/src/socketservice and server/src/socketserver back into code generation
    - including doing the per-message parts based on the query manifest
    - lots of duplicated code between these files.

Shared observable DB example with two websites editing the same in-memory DB


accept query maps in the query manifest that show how to upgrade and downgrade queries
    - Then automatically infer some relationships and generate "share via downgrade" using this generic facility

query caching in the db

generate typings for query binds
validate querymanifest so that it makes sense

piece together the table manifest from multiple files
piece together the query manifest from multiple files
    - generate one IHandler interface for each manifest file, rather than one interface for each query.

how to share code between socketservice and socketserver?
    - Generate it in both projects?
        - makes sense since we want to be language-agnostic, and shared code only works if both sides are TS
    - Shareable code: decode a wire message, and encode a wire response
        - Nonshareable code: How to dispatch across the wire. 
            - Client side needs to send a request and then put responses into the rowcache
            - Server side needs to call a handler method and watch the response, no caching
