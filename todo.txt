get normal queries working 
    - why won't the responses decode?
    - Need to let the server know whether it's an observe or a query 
        - put something in the envelope
    - Need a way to cancel observes

get normal queries caching in the db

accept query maps in the query manifest that show how to upgrade and downgrade queries
    - Then automatically infer some relationships and generate "share via downgrade" using this generic facility

generate insert messages
    - Command Result

generate diff messages 
    - and code to apply diffs

generate typings for query binds

validate querymanifest so that it makes sense

piece together the table manifest from multiple files
piece together the query manifest from multiple files
    - generate one IHandler interface for each manifest file, rather than one interface for each query.

how to share code between socketservice and socketserver?
    - Generate it in both projects?
        - makes sense since we want to be language-agnostic, and shared code only works if both sides are TS
    - Shareable code: decode a wire message, and encode a wire response
        - Nonshareable code: How to dispatch across the wire. 
            - Client side needs to send a request and then put responses into the rowcache
            - Server side needs to call a handler method and watch the response, no caching
